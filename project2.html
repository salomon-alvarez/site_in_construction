                <h1>Supply Chain Modeling</h1>
                <p><strong>This project demonstrated that supply chain-based forecasting using deep learning achieved a higher predictive accuracy for Intel’s stock price than traditional competitor-based models.</strong></p>
            </header>

            <p>The goal of this project is to explore the idea that the systematic study of the movement in prices of businesses that comprise the supply chain of a certain company can lead to predicting the stock's price of this very company. Since a supply chain is "a network between a company and its suppliers to produce and distribute a specific product to the final buyer," we believe we can estimate what is happening at a certain point on a river by observing what is happening upstream and downstream.</p>

            <p>If the biggest clients of a certain company are not performing well, it could be expected that their biggest supplier will suffer undesirable consequences. For example, if a key supplier is having trouble procuring a commodity due to climate or political unrest, and that commodity is essential for producing a final product, the impact can ripple through the supply chain. Think, for example, of silicon used in semiconductors for laptops.</p>

            <p>We propose building machine learning models where the features are the companies that constitute the supply chain of a chosen target company. This approach offers a unique form of fundamental analysis centered around the supply chain to forecast stock prices using machine learning.</p>

            <p>To test the deep learning model, Intel Corp was selected as the target. The features were as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Suppliers:</strong> Applied Materials, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing</li>
                <li><strong>Distributors:</strong> Arrow Corporation, Avnet Inc, Synnex Corporation</li>
                <li><strong>Clients:</strong> Dell, HP, Lenovo</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We also built a comparative model using the stock prices of Intel’s direct competitors: AMD, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, Broadcom, Micron Technologies, and Texas Instruments. We ran deep learning and machine learning regression models for both analyses to compare forecasting performance.</p>

            <p>The deep learning model was built in Keras with hyperparameters optimized through trial and error. We used k-fold cross-validation to ensure consistency across samples.</p>

            <img src="images/p2_loss_vs_epochs.png" alt="Loss vs Epochs" style="width:100%; margin: 2em 0;" />

            <p>Performance was tracked using mean absolute error across epochs, and a loss comparison between training and validation sets to assess underfitting or overfitting.</p>

            <img src="images/p2_competition.png" alt="Prediction Using Competitor Stocks" style="width:100%; margin: 2em 0;" />

            <p>The prediction results clearly show that the supply chain-based model outperforms the competitor-based approach. The scatter plots of predicted vs. actual values show tighter clustering and better fit lines in the supply chain model.</p>

            <img src="images/p2_correlation_comp.png" alt="Correlation Competitors" style="width:100%; margin: 2em 0;" />

            <p>Correlation between predicted and actual prices:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Supply Chain (Deep Learning): 0.9872</li>
                <li>Supply Chain (Regression): 0.8614</li>
                <li>Competitors (Deep Learning): 0.9602</li>
                <li>Competitors (Regression): 0.8277</li>
            </ul>

            <img src="images/p2_results.png" alt="Results Sample" style="width:100%; margin: 2em 0;" />

            <p>This table shows a sample of Intel's real vs. predicted prices. The improved accuracy supports the use of supply chain modeling as a novel and effective tool for equity price forecasting.</p>
