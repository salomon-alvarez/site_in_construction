        <h1>Investment Portfolios Analysis</h1>
        <p><strong>Compared returns, volatility, Sharpe ratios, and risk of portfolios from hedge funds, whales like Buffett, algorithmic strategies, and a custom-built portfolio — finding one strategy that consistently beat the S&P 500.</strong></p>
      </header>

      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>In this analysis, I examined the performance of several portfolios, including algorithmic strategies (Algo1 and Algo2), portfolios from renowned institutional investors ("whales"), and a custom portfolio I created. I compared them against the S&P 500 across key financial metrics like cumulative return, volatility, standard deviation, correlation, Sharpe ratio, and rolling beta.</p>

      <h2>Performance Analysis</h2>
      <p>We began by visualizing cumulative returns to compare how each portfolio performed over time.</p>

      <p>All portfolios eventually outperformed the S&P 500, but not throughout the entire timeline. Around April 2016, the S&P briefly outpaced all except Algo1. The algorithmic strategies showed promising consistency in long-term returns.</p>

      <h2>Risk Analysis</h2>
      <p>The daily returns and standard deviations gave us insight into risk and variability.</p>

      <p>Box plots revealed that <strong>PAULSON & CO.INC.</strong> had the smallest spread in returns, while <strong>BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.</strong> had the largest — making it the riskiest. This was confirmed with standard deviation values.</p>

      <h2>Rolling Standard Deviation</h2>
      <p>Rolling standard deviations show how risk fluctuates over time. Generally, all portfolios followed similar risk trends, but with differences in intensity and timing.</p>
      <p>For example, between July 2015 and January 2016, S&P 500 risk increased while Algo1’s risk actually decreased — an example of inverse behavior.</p>

      <h2>Correlation to Market</h2>
      <p>We computed correlations to understand how closely each portfolio mimicked the S&P 500. <strong>PAULSON & CO.INC.</strong> had the highest correlation to the market, suggesting it tracks the index most closely.</p>

      <h2>Rolling Beta</h2>
      <p>By plotting the rolling beta for <strong>BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.</strong>, we could evaluate its sensitivity to the S&P 500. Interestingly, when market risk was low, the beta approached 1 — suggesting alignment. But when the market became volatile, Berkshire reduced exposure, showing a contrarian risk approach.</p>

      <h2>Sharpe Ratios</h2>
      <p>Sharpe ratios help determine return relative to risk. Here’s how the portfolios compared:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Algo1</strong> had the highest Sharpe ratio, outperforming all others</li>
        <li><strong>Algo2</strong> came next, beating all except Berkshire Hathaway and Algo1</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Custom Portfolio Analysis</h2>
      <p>I created a custom portfolio from handpicked stocks, calculated the daily returns, and incorporated it into the comparison framework.</p>
      <p><strong>Results:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>It had the highest cumulative return over the entire period</li>
        <li>Its risk was higher than all but Berkshire Hathaway</li>
        <li>Sharpe ratio was second only to Algo1</li>
        <li>Rolling beta increased as S&P 500 became more stable</li>
        <li>Most correlated to Algo2 (corr = 0.755)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Both algorithmic strategies — especially Algo1 — delivered consistent returns with superior risk-adjusted performance. The custom portfolio proved to be a strong contender as well, confirming that with thoughtful stock selection, individual investors can potentially outperform institutional strategies.</p>
